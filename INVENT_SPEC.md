Evaluate the scene clarity surrounding the cat. Determine the degree to which the background and surrounding environment yield to the cat, allowing it to stand as the unambiguous subject of the image. Consider whether the space around the cat is clean and simple — letting the cat visually stand out without competition — or whether it is cluttered, chaotic, and filled with competing visual elements that pull the viewer's attention away. Also consider whether objects partially obstruct the cat, whether patterns or colors camouflage it, or whether the cat blends into its surroundings in a way that makes it visually indistinct. Score higher (closer to 1) when the scene cooperates with the cat's dominance — the background is clean, uncluttered, and the cat is visually distinct from its surroundings. Score lower (closer to 0) when visual noise, clutter, competing objects, obstructions, or camouflage undermine the cat's authority as the clear, unambiguous subject of the photograph.
