1. Evaluate the simplicity of the background and surrounding environment. Determine whether the space behind and around the cat is clean, calm, and visually restrained — serving as a quiet canvas that recedes from the viewer's attention — or whether it is cluttered with competing visual elements such as other objects, busy patterns, other animals, or bright distracting details that fracture the viewer's gaze and force the cat to share attention. A simple background is one that does nothing but yield to the cat. A cluttered background shouts over it.

2. Evaluate the visual distinction between the cat and its surroundings. Determine whether a clear perceptual boundary exists between the cat and the environment it inhabits — whether contrast in color, brightness, or texture allows the eye to instantly parse where the cat ends and the world begins — or whether the cat is absorbed into its setting through similar colors, matching patterns, or low contrast that erases the boundary between subject and background. A visually distinct cat pops forward in the scene. A visually indistinct cat dissolves into it.

3. Evaluate the degree to which the cat's body is free from physical obstruction. Determine whether the cat is fully visible and openly presented to the viewer — its entire form available and unblocked — or whether objects, surfaces, or other elements in the scene partially hide, cover, or stand in front of the cat, fragmenting its form and breaking the line of sight between the viewer and the subject. An unobstructed cat is received whole. An obscured cat is received only as a fragment.
